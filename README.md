# Luxury Meet Blockchain - Project LMB - Supply Chain

Project LMB is a minimum viable prototype for Luxury product tracking with Blockchain technology.

It considers three roles in the Luxury asset tracking in supply chain:
- Manufacturer
- Retailers - Distribution Market
- Final Customer - or Second-hand market

During the different supply chain process, the following information is tracked in the blockchain (as examples):
- Creation of asset (Luxury product)
- Change of owner: distribution and transfer from manufacturer to retailers
- Key product information
- Owner authorization (only current owner can transfer the ownership to another account)
